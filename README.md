# ProjektInzynierskiWPF
The aim of this work was to build an application that realizes an escape algorithm from the grid. A grid is a kind of graph, creating a kind of matrix, in which the points of intersection between the edges can be described by a pair of numbers - row and column number. The escape from the grid consists in placing on the grid a selected number of so-called escapees, and then leading the paths for each escapee to the edges of the grid, in such a way that they do not intersect with each other. The application has been created in C# language and using .NET 3 technology. The final part of the work presents examples illustrating the possibilities of using the application.
